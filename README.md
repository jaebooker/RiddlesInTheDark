You're up at night, can't sleep, need to wind down and exercise your mind.
That's where we come in.
Each night, at midnight, users of the app will receive a new riddle.
24 Hours later, they will have access to the answer, and a new riddle!
Like Bilbo Baggins and Gollum down in the Mines of Moria, we will be telling riddles.
Riddles In The Dark.
